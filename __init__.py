# Cloudy: a modern simulator of cloud environments

Cloudy is a framework for modeling and simulating cloud computing environments and services. It enables the creation of
virtualized cloud computing environments, and provides a comprehensive set of features for simulating and analyzing the
performance of cloud infrastructures. The goal is to enable researchers and developers to evaluate the performance of
their cloud-based applications and services in a realistic simulated environment. The simulator is a valuable tool for
developers, allowing them to test their applications and services in a realistic environment without the need for a
physical cloud environment.

## Getting started

The simulator is designed to be easy to use and extend. To run Cloudy,

1. Clone the project

```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/ahmad-siavashi/cloudy.git 
```

2. Install [Python 3.10](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
3. Run the example

```bash
$ python3 example.py
```

That's all. The code is minimal, self-documented and easy to read. You can quickly start coding by reading
the existing code and example.

## Contribution

The simulator is a work in progress. Please feel free to develop new features or make improvements. You can contact me
through email at siavashi@aut.ac.ir.
